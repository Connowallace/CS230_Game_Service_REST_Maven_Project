# CS230_Game_Service_REST_Maven_Project
Project to design a game service for managing multiple games, and a Maven server for hosting.

Please note this project does not function to host a game server. The goals are explained below:

Project 1:

Create object oriented Java code to create a Singleton Game Service that manages any number of players, teams, and games.
All code for this project was written by me based on a framework provided by the class.

Project 2:

Given a non-functioning Maven project, update it to allow users of different access levels to log in and view information available to their account type.
